## z80cpu

A collection of JAVA emulations for CPUs based on the 8080.

Currently includes I8080, Z80, and Z180.

See the class "Computer" for how a machine interfaces with the CPU.
The class "CPU" describes an abstract version of the instantiated
CPU, but does not provide all possible interfaces.

z80cpu.jar is included, but may be rebuilt using "make" in top-level
directory.
